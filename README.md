# Quantova Developer Content

This repository holds the developer documentation and tutorials for [Quantova](https://quantova.org), a sovereign post quantum Layer 1 built from scratch.

The content is Markdown organized by topic. Each topic is a folder that contains an `index.md`. The files are consumed by the Quantova website and rendered with the docs and tutorial layouts.

## Conventions

One folder per topic. A page lives at `…/<topic>/index.md`. For example, `quantova.org/developers/docs/qorus-consensus/` is built from `public/content/developers/docs/qorus-consensus/index.md`.

Frontmatter. Every `index.md` starts with YAML frontmatter that carries `title`, `description`, and `lang` for docs. Tutorials add `published`, `skill`, and `tags`.

Internal links are root relative, for example `/developers/docs/accounts/`.

## Contributing

See CONTRIBUTING.md. In short, edit or add an `index.md` under the right topic folder, keep the frontmatter, use root relative links, and open a pull request.
